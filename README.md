# The Calorie Counter

This is my first independent react project. At the end of its development, it should meet the following requirements:

- Perform CRUD operations on user-added foods, alongside quantity, units, and kcal 
- Provide the user with a dashboard to display average kcal consumption and kcal consumed over time
- Let the user add foods they consumed throughout the day along with the quantity of that food

## API
This will be made with Express and SQLite to facilitate CRUD operations and storage of data
