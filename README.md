# The Calorie Counter

This is my first real project for creating a web app
  
---
There are 2 main components. Each has their own README file for extra information

## App
This will be made with React as its framework to provide the user with a user-friendly and visually-appealing access point

## API
This was originally made with Express and SQLite to facilitate CRUD operations and storage of data. MySQL is now used to remain compatible with google cloud SQL
